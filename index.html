          <h1>Hey, I'm Lex!</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a Leaving Cert student in Ireland. I have been interested in
            programming ever since I was 5, and my skills have been advancing
            with every year. I love to both create things, and figure out how
            things work under the hood. Whenever I want to do something I’ll
            quickly figure out what is needed, and will learn as I’m creating!
